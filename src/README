AUTHORS

This program was created by Keldon Jones <keldon@keldon.net>.  Many
useful improvements, especially to the GUI, were made by B. Nordli
<BGG user borgemik>.

COMPILATION

A simple "./configure && make && make install" should suffice.  You
may need to install any development packages for libgtk.

RUNNING

Run with "./rftg".  You may specify number of players, expansion level,
etc with some command line options:

	-n <name>      -- Set the name of the human player
	-s <savegame>  -- Load a savegame when starting the program
	-r <num>       -- A seed to pick when initializing the random pool
	-p <num>       -- Number of players (including yourself)
	-a             -- Play a two-player advanced game
	-e <expansion> -- Expansion level to play:
				0: Base game only
				1: The Gathering Storm
				2: Rebel vs Imperium
				3: The Brink of War
				4: Alien Artifacts
	-g, -nog       -- Enable or disable goals
	-t, -not       -- Enable or disable takeovers
	-c <name>      -- Play a campaign with the given name

You may also change these setting once the game is running with the
"Select Parameters" option under the Game menu.

INTERFACE

Cards in your hand are displayed across the bottom of the window.  Your
active cards are just above, in the blue-shaded area.  Your opponents
active cards will be displayed in the top colored areas.

You may move your pointer over any card to see a full-sized version in
the upper-left.

In between your hand and active area is a prompt asking for your next
play.  Typically this is a request to choose an action, choose a card
to play or cards to discard, etc.  Select an action (or two actions if
playing the two-player advanced game) by using the action buttons.
Select cards to play or discard by clicking on them in your hand area.
When you are satisfied, click the "Done" button at the far right of the
prompt area.  This button will not be clickable if your current
selection is not legal.

You can right-click a card to select all other cards (for example, when
Exploring).
